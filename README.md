## Abstract

This project applies data-driven analysis to Adidas sales data to identify key drivers of revenue, profitability, and regional performance. Using exploratory data analysis and visualization, sales data is cleaned and aggregated across products, retailers, regions, and sales methods to uncover actionable insights. The analysis shows that in-store sales consistently generate the highest profitability, while outlet sales perform strongly in high–foot-traffic cities, highlighting the importance of channel strategy. Regional analysis identifies New York, Miami, Charleston (SC), San Francisco, and Houston as top-performing cities, and retailer-level results show that althought West Gear generates the highest profit, Walmart generates the highest profit per store. Product analysis further reveals that men’s street footwear, women’s apparel, and men’s athletic footwear are consistently high-performing categories across cities, indicating stable demand. Overall, this project demonstrates how analytics can translate raw sales data into insights that inform channel optimization, regional investment, and product strategy.
