## Abstract

This project applies data-driven analysis to Adidas sales data to identify key drivers of revenue, profitability, and regional performance. Using exploratory data analysis and visualization, the data is cleaned and aggregated across products, retailers, regions, and sales methods to uncover patterns in sales and profit. The analysis shows that in-store sales consistently generate the highest profitability, while outlet sales tend to perform well in cities with high foot traffic, highlighting differences in channel performance. Regional results show that New York, Miami, Charleston (SC), San Francisco, and Houston are among the most profitable cities. At the retailer level, while West Gear generates the highest total profit, Walmart produces the highest profit per store. Product analysis further shows that men’s street footwear, women’s apparel, and men’s athletic footwear consistently perform well across cities, suggesting stable demand.
